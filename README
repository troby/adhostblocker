This script is designed to append the existing system hosts file with a list of bad
hosts to be redirected to localhost. This list is taken from someonewhocares.org
and maintained by Dan Pollock. You may contact hosts@someonewhocares.org for updates
to the list itself.

The variable system_hosts should be redefined if '/etc/hosts' is not correct for
your system. You must run this script under a user who has permissions to write to
the system_hosts file.

This script is designed to be run on a regular interval with minimal overhead and a
silent death if there is no working internet connection.
